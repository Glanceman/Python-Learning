    "## Goal\n",
    "In this assignment, the task is predict whether an SMS message is a real message, a spam message, or a phishing message (called smishing). Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Normal**: \"For real tho this sucks. I can't even cook my whole electricity is out. And I'm hungry.\"\n",
    "  - **Spam**: \"Had your mobile 10 mths? Update to latest Orange camera/video phones for FREE. Save Â£s with Free texts/weekend calls. Text YES for a callback orno to opt out\"\n",
    "  - **Smishing**: \"Todays Vodafone numbers ending 5347 are selected to receive a Rs.2,00,000 award. If you have a match please call 6299257179 quoting claim code 2041 standard rates apply\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to train a classifier to predict the class from the SMS text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "You need to train classifiers using the training data, and then predict on the test data. You are free to choose the feature extraction method and classifier algorithm.  You are free to use methods that were not introduced in class.  You should probably do cross-validation to select a good parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation on Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit your test predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.  50% of the test data will be used to show your ranking on the live leaderboard.  After the assignment deadline, the remaining 50% will be used to calculate your final ranking. Also the top-ranked entries will be asked to give a short 5 minute presentation on what they did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric used on Kaggle is **balanced accuracy score**. This is because the dataset has some class imbalance as there are more normal samples than spam/smishing samples. See details for `sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit to Kaggle you need to create an account, and use the competition invitation that is posted to Canvas. You must submit your Kaggle account name to the \"Kaggle Username\" assignment on Canvas **1 week before the Assignment 1 deadline**. This is to prevent students from creating multiple Kaggle accounts to gain unfair advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can only submit 2 times per day to Kaggle!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to hand in\n",
    "You need to turn in the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This ipynb file with your source code and documentation. _**You should write about all the various attempts that you make to find a good solution.**_ You may also submit python scripts as source code, but your documentation must be in the ipynb file.\n",
    "2. Your final csv submission file to Kaggle.\n",
    "3. The ipynb file `Assignment1-Final.ipynb`, which contains the code that generates the final submission file that you submit to Kaggle.  **This code will be used to verify that your Kaggle submission is reproducible.**\n",
    "4. Your Kaggle username (submitted to the \"Kaggle Username\" assignment on Canvas 1 week before the Assignment 1 deadline)\n",
    "\n",
    "Files should be uploaded to Assignment 1 on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "The marks of the assignment are distributed as follows:\n",
    "- 45% - Results using various classifiers and feature representations.\n",
    "- 30% - Trying out feature representations (e.g. adding additional features) or classifiers not used in the tutorials/lectures.\n",
    "- 20% - Quality of the written report.  More points for insightful observations and analysis.\n",
    "- 5% - Final ranking on the Kaggle test data (private leaderboard). Only the Kaggle username submitted to Canvas on time will be considered. If a submission cannot be reproduced by the submitted code, it will not receive marks for ranking.\n",
    "- **Late Penalty:** 25 marks will be subtracted for each day late.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This is an _individual_ assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** you should start early! Some classifiers may take a while to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kaggle Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, you can use Kaggle notebooks to run your code. Note that you still need to submit your code to Canvas for grading.\n",
