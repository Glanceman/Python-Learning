      "An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.\n",
      "White firefighter Lt. Daniel McWilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flag-bearing unit at a November 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternal society of black firefighters.\n",
      "And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.\n",
      "McWilliams was one of the three FDNY firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the American flag at Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks.\n",
      "According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.\n",
      "Being a flag bearer at the event was an 'esteemed honor and privilege' for McWilliams, according to his lawsuit, CNN reported.\n",
      "Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.\n",
      "She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year FDNY veteran - to 'help in a different capacity.'\n",
      "Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.\n",
      "McWilliams claimed in his suit that he asked Wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because he's not black.\n",
      "She confirmed that was the case, he said.\n",
      "Wilson, a 21-year FDNY veteran who was also part of the 9/11 rescue efforts, apparently replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.\n",
      "McWilliams claimed he left the memorial 'to save himself from further shame, humiliation and embarrassment,' as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues, the New York Daily News reported.\n",
      "During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'\n",
      "'No, it isn't,' Loving said, according to the New York Post.\n",
      "Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'\n",
      "By way of explanation, Loving said that it was OK to swap out a white person for a black person to 'uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another.'\n",
      "McWilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the FDNY in January 2018.\n",
      "He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the FDNY, the city of New York and unnamed individuals in May 2019.\n",
      "After filing his complaint, Sullivan said that McWilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by Wilson's supporters.\n",
      "At one point, one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on McWilliams and said: 'I've heard about you, they told me you'd act this way, and now you know me.'\n",
      "In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.\n",
      "'If you're black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a slap on the wrist at best,' Sullivan wrote.\n",
      "Wilson, according to the lawsuit, received 'one hour of counseling' over her treatment of McWilliams.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives 'heavy-handed discipline and punishment,' Sullivan wrote.\n",
      "'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.\n",

      "Last year, of 49,324 Victorian students to complete the VCE, only 628, or 1 per cent, did Australian history.\n",
      "Over the past six years, this figure has been almost halved, with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year.\n",
      "A key reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion.\n",
      "History is not even a standalone learning area, but is subsumed within the broader \"humanities.\"\n",
      "So across years 7 and 8, students complete only one short unit on ancient \"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture.\"\n",
      "Then, in years 9 and 10, there is another unit focusing on Australia during the world wars.\n",

      "At years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit covering the period from 1750-1918.\n",
      "Three actions should urgently be taken to save Australian history in Victorian schools.\n",
      "First, history must become a standalone learning area like English, maths and science.\n",
      "Because history is taught only as part of the humanities, it is given little space within the curriculum.\n",
      "It is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves.\n",
      "Historical skills, such as the analysis of evidence, are complex.\n",
      "We must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way.\n",
      "Third, the study of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory.\n",
      "Students love familiarity.\n",
      "So many of my former students decided against Australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch.\n",

      "During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.\n",
      "The answer to that question - at least for now - we may never know.\n",
      "Wallace on Sunday informed viewers that the Biden campaign told Fox News he was \"not available\" for an interview.\n",
      "\"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter,\" Wallace said.\n",
      "\"This week, we asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available.\"\n",
      "He added, \"We'll keep asking every week.\"\n",
      "The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "While Biden recently has returned to the stump, Trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for \"hiding\" in his home in Delaware.\n",
      "Biden's reticence to do public events, however, has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had Biden comfortably ahead of Trump both nationally and in key battleground states.\n",
      "Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.\n",
      "Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.\n",
      "The latest Fox News Polls put Biden ahead in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with leads all outside the margin of error.\n",
      "Polling also suggested Biden had a slight edge in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important swing states this cycle.\n",
      "And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.\n",
      "Presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the White House are often a referendum on that president - and that's seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden.\n",

      "Villagers rushed to the scene to attend to the fallen driver and retrieve the fallen shipments.\n",
      "One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his view that the driver was \"a passerby in front of our village; we could not leave him alone.\n",
      "We should help anyone, whatever their identity, if they are in distress.\"\n",
      "He added that the villagers brought an ambulance to retrieve the driver, and then attempted to retrieve the truck's goods, estimated to be worth three million LE.\n",
      "According to Bahr, the villagers stayed at the scene from morning to night retrieving as many shipments as they could.\n",
      "\"The most important thing for us was to save the driver's life, protect the shipment, and open up the international road,\" he explained.\n",

      "\"But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation's original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding.\"\n",
      "The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.\n",
      "It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.\n",
      "If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.\n",
      "\"Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why,\" the report said.\n",
      "\"But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue.\"\n",
      "The document says Congress needs \"more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress.\n",

      "I'm here to help people' - Chimaev after making history on UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News\n",
      "Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.\n",
      "Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.\n",
      "The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.\n",
      "The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.\n",
      "Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.\n",
      "\"I do this not only for me, I do this for everybody I can help.\n",
      "I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, to show my money or something like that.\n",
      "I want to help people,\" replied Chimaev when asked on Fight Island about how he would spend his bonus.\n",
      "One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev \"easily.\"\n",
      "That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would \"smash Danis with his eyes closed.\"\n",
      "Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.\n",
      "\"I can smash everybody...\n",
      "How many fighters in the welterweight division?\n",
      "I can smash all of them,\" he said.\n",

      "Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.\n",
      "Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.\n",
      "The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.\n",
      "\"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game,\" he said.\n",
      "\"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you.\"\n",
      "Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.\n",
      "But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.\n",
      "\"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams.\"\n",
      "\"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important.\"\n",
      "\"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.\n",

      "The Istanbul Convention is the world's first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as \"harmful\" because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.\n",

      "Gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it \"very hard to open\" schools in fall\n",
      "Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday it's going to be \"very hard\" for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities.\n",
      "\"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.\n",
      "If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop.\" Gottlieb said on \"Face the Nation.\"\n",
      "With the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for in-person instruction five days a week.\n",
      "But the push from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos comes as Mr. Trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely \"get worse before it gets better\" and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks.\n",
      "Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance Thursday for how best to safely open schools for students.\n",
      "The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.\n",
      "But the CDC did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections, which Gottlieb said was \"unfortunate.\"\n",
      "\"In the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution,\" he said.\n",
      "\"That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the CDC didn't do in its guidance.\"\n",
      "Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.\n",
      "A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is \"starting to get iffy,\" while above 10% is the \"threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts.\"\n",
      "\"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community,\" Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.\n",
      "More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.\n",
      "But Gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including Arizona and Texas are beginning to plateau.\n",
      "While Gottlieb said there are \"unmistakable signs\" the epidemic is slowing in some states across the Sun Belt, it's \"heating up\" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.\n",
      "Many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n",
      "Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.\n",
      "In addition to states issuing mask mandates, a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well.\n",
      "McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.\n",
      "Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.\n",
      "\"If we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness, just with masks that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school,\" he said.\n",
      "While Mr. Trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate, he urged Americans last week to wear coverings, saying during a White House press briefing \"they have an impact.\"\n",

      "\"We've really listened, and it was a really key thing in formulating this program,\" Ms Ronson said.\n",
      "\"We don't think people will want to recycle the books - we think they'll want to keep them, but they can recycle them at home if they wish to.\"\n",
      "Ms Ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she believed the timing was \"quite good\" for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children.\n",
      "Analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets, but Ms Ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet.\n",
      "\"We're not seeing any of that so far, but we do constantly look out for it,\" she said.\n",
      "\"We analyse a lot of data, week to week, month to month, to make sure we're launching things that really resonate with the customer base.\"\n",
      "Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.\n",
      "Woolworths has since followed suit with its Lion King Ooshies campaign, which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales, and most recently, its eco-friendly Discovery Garden promotion, which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant.\n",
      "However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.\n",
      "Ms Ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future, with promotions such as Little Shop likely to appear less often.\n",
      "\"There's a lot of these collectible-type campaigns to look to around the world, and we're constantly drawing inspiration from overseas,\" she said.\n",
      "\"We should be doing those sorts of things to make sure we're constantly raising the bar with our own customer base.\"\n",

      "Maurice Petty, Hall of Fame engine builder, dies at 81\n",
      "KANSAS CITY, Kan.(AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a stock car racing dynasty that includes father Lee and brother Richard and the first engine builder to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, died Saturday.\n",
      "He was 81.\n",
      "Petty's family did not disclose the cause of death.\n",
      "No funeral arrangements have been announced.\n",
      "While other family members were acclaimed for their ability behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname \"The Chief\" for his ability to turn a wrench.\n",
      "He helped his family win 198 races and seven championships in NASCAR's premier series, and he also built engines that carried Hall of Famer Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton to victory.\n",
      "\"The Chief was one of the most talented mechanics in NASCAR history,\" chairman and chief executive Jim France.\n",
      "\"He provided the power that helped Petty Enterprises define dominance in sports.\n",
      "While he was known for his work under the hood, Maurice played multiple behind-the-scenes roles, doing what it took to help deliver his cars to victory lane.\"\n",
      "Maurice Petty was born March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.\n",
      "He would tail his father to the track while growing up, and his mechanical know-how soon played an integral part in Lee Petty winning 54 races and three championships.\n",
      "He made 26 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1960-64, finishing in the top 5 seven times with 16 top-10 runs.\n",
      "But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.\n",
      "Richard, who would take on the nickname \"The King,\" won his first championship along with The Chief when he drove a Plymouth to the 1964 title.\n",
      "They won again in 1967, back-to-back titles in 1970 and \"71, and added three more before the 1970s drew to an end.\n",
      "The seven titles remains tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the most in history.\n",
      "\"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers in NASCAR who helped build one of NASCAR's dominant teams in Petty Enterprises,\" Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley said in a statement.\n",
      "\"Although the record shows 212 victories, Petty has well over 250 wins to his credit considering all the engines he built for his competitors.\n",
      "Chief will forever be remember as one of the best to build power plants in NASCAR.\"\n",
      "Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, Patricia, died in 2014.\n",
      "He also was the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyle Petty and Truck Series crew chief Trent Owens.\n",
      "\"While we have lost one of NASCAR's true, gritty pioneers and heroes, Maurice Petty's legacy and memory will always be remembered, preserved, celebrated and cherished,\" Kelley said.\n",
      "\"We offer our sincere condolences to the Petty family.\"\n",

      "An angler threw a beer bottle at a seal when it interfered with his fishing line, a charity has said.\n",
      "Photos taken at Hope's Nose, near Torquay, appear to show a man hurling a projectile at the creature from a cliff.\n",
      "Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the angler emptied the bottle and launched it, hitting the animal on the back.\n",
      "Mr Kenny called it \"appalling and inconsiderate behaviour.\"\n",
      "He said he was collecting litter at the Devon beauty spot with members of the Seal Project conservation charity when he witnessed the attack on Sunday morning.\n",
      "\"The seal made an attempt to get the fishing line,\" he said.\n",
      "\"The angler finished his beer, drained the bottle and threw it at the seal.\n",
      "\"The bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off.\"\n",
      "Mr Kenny said that \"fortunately seals are robust creatures,\" but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature.\n",
      "\"By throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting,\" he said.\n",
      "The Seal Project said it was \"not an isolated case\" and it had received \"numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently.\"\n",
      "In a Facebook post, it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during Sunday's visit to Hope's Nose and observed \"multiple examples of antisocial behaviour.\"\n",

      "Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever'\n",
      "Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever' after defying Boris Johnson's call for them to get back into the office\n",
      "Union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to \"stay at home forever\" after defying Boris Johnson's clarion call for workers to get back to the office.\n",
      "Tory MPs reacted with anger after the Public and Commercial Services Union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks.\n",
      "Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was \"unacceptable\" that vital public-sector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis.\n",
      "\"It's unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Many of those workers would now like a holiday and can't have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely.\n",
      "\"The union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever - especially not now that we know people can return to work safely.\"\n",
      "Following the Prime Minister's call, Alex Chisholm, the Civil Service's new chief operating officer, last week told all ministries that it was time to \"change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1.\"\n",
      "But the Public and Commercial Services Union told its 200,000 members they did not have to accept that guidance, claiming it was a political issue.\n",
      "A spokesman for the PCS, Britain's largest civil service union, said the back-to-the-office demand \"is not based on our members\" health and safety, or on helping our economy.\n",
      "It is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some Tory MPs who are demanding that the Civil Service is used as an example to get everybody back to work.\n",
      "\"Our advice to members is clear: if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work, don't just accept that's what you have to do.\"\n",
      "The dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by home-working, with more than 400,000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.\n",
      "The Home Office has now said it will \"seek to expedite\" applications from Britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the Passport Office for more than four weeks.\n",
      "The PCS has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that \"small and often cramped offices\" make social distancing difficult for the Passport Office's 4,000 staff.\n",
      "Former Cabinet Minister David Davis urged civil service union chiefs to \"behave responsibly\" and work with the Government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces.\n",
      "He added that if he was in Government, he would be asking union leaders: \"What are you suggesting? That you stay [at home] all summer?\"\n",
      "However, Mr Johnson's plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of Britain's top firms.\n",
      "A study of big employers with a total of 400,000 staff between them found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to the workplace.\n"
